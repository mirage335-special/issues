Basic issue tracker emphasizing portability, reliability, usability (ie. simplicity), and history, using git repository.

Most often, issues tracked here will be 'PENDING' - issues which have been solved upstream (eg. "ubiquitous_bash"), but for which the corrections have not yet 'trickled down' to derivative products (eg. 'extendedInterface' installer, 'ubDistBuild' installer and ubdist/OS, etc).









Some of the issues tracked herein concern projects of other corporations, etc (eg. Soaring Distributions LLC). These corporations may have their own issue trackers, or not. The presence or reliance of this issue tracker does not affect the corporate nature of those projects, rather, this issue tracker is merely a tool used and owned by either that corporation, or another corporate entity, etc, or an actual person, etc, and may reflect either that corporation's reliance on that other entity, or that other entity's interest, partnership, etc. The underlying projects of course remain owned by their copyright claimants, etc, and those distributing owners or other distributors are responsible for the distribution, etc.
