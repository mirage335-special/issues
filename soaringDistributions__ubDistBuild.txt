_ locale config on first boot _

Some applications, including 'k3b' may show cosmetic errors, possibly or not, due to the locale having been configured within a chroot .

Adding locale config command to the first boot commands (ie. to run within qemu) may or may not resolve such errors.

Then again, this may be a very bad idea:
*) Only 'k3b' is known to show this error, with zero expected impactful issues as a result.
*) Configuration of locale is known to present the possibility of serious issues with at least gEDA/gschem/gsch2pcb/pcb , FreeCAD , AppImage , Nix package manager and Nix installed packages, etc.

Thus, this is NOT A PRIORITY, and changes will NOT be implemented until sufficient time and opportunity is available to adequately test for any possible consequences.
