Should be copied by ubDistBuild.exe installer to C:\core\installations .

_ kernel _

Kernel names absolutely should have local version.

Kernel config should now exist at /lib/modules/<kernel>/build/.config for DKMS .



_ upgrade runner _

scribe '/info-github-upgrade'

DISABLE_RELEASE - Ensure workflow steps (including all hashing) are correctly disabled (or remain enabled), for fast and correct work and analysis.


kernel should be upgraded from 6.12.8 to 6.12.9, stock kernels should be removed

apt upgrades should have taken effect - there should be no upgrades available

preliminary gpd driver structure should be present (and hopefully... kernel module should be capable of fan control... shell script fan control close to working... temperature detection/control can be corrected in shell script...)

kde package upgrade should not have caused any issues...

upgrade_installers - MSW exe installers, if present, should be upgraded



_ custom runner _

scribe '/info-github-custom'
 with build_DANGERfast_EXPERIMENT ... if that was used

DISABLE_RELEASE - Ensure workflow steps (including all hashing) are correctly disabled (or remain enabled), for fast and correct work and analysis.

DANGERfast_EXPERIMENT - Skips all hashing steps. Renames tag accordingly.
