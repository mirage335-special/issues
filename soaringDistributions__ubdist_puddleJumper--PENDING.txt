_ Kernel Headers Permissions/Owners _

Linux kernel headers under /usr/src and available through /lib/modules ... apparently are owned by 'brig:docker' . A corresponding chown command in puddleJumper scripts does not seem to exist, suggesting this results from building the Debian kernel packages with non-root user.

Docker built kernel package should now not have this issue.
