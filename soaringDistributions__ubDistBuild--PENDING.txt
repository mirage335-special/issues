_ aa_DAMAGE_CONTROL _

All ubdist/OS builds should now always have the aa_DAMAGE_CONTROL at "$HOME"/core/info/aa_DAMAGE_CONTROL .


_ filezilla _

Should be copied by ubDistBuild.exe installer to C:\core\installations .


_ custom runner _

upgrade_installers - MSW exe installers, if present, should be upgraded



_ from ubiquitous_bash - ingredients _

_set_ingredients

	if _set_ingredients
	then
		sudo -n mkdir -p "$absolute1"/mnt/ingredients
		_bindMountManager "$ub_INGREDIENTS" "$absolute1"/mnt/ingredients

_ ollama ls  during install _

May now call 'ollama ls' to start ollama . Should not, but may, cause installer not to close, or installer may close the ollama instance that was started as a result.



_ ollama  port conflict _

If  ollama  is not available when the installer is run, but is installed subsequently, then a reboot may be required before ollama will be able to bind to the localhost/port as usual, due to the port forwarding itself occupying a port if already running before  ollama  .


_ ollama  rootfs disable _

ollama service is disabled, stopped, etc, both from ChRoot, and during install of the wsl vm (ie. wsl guest)

if this is not disabled as expected and without errors, build failures, installation failures, and conflicts with MSWindows host  ollama  service may occur




_ codex , npm _

codex , npm, possibly also claude code  ... should now be installed with ubdist/OS


this is implemented through ubiquitous_bash 'dev ai' and also through additions to 'rotten_install'
